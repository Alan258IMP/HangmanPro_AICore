# Hangman Project
This Python project is an implementation of a classic game called Hangman in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess the word one letter at a time.

The class Hangman encodes the game and the play_game() function runs the game.

## Milestone 2

I then created the ask_letter() method by requesting an input from the user.

The input character has to be one single English letter that has not yet been tried. Input with more than 1 characters or characters not in the English alphabet are not accepted. The user will be asked iteratively until a valid input is given. Note that uppercase letter input will be converted to lowercase.

## Milestone 3

I filled in the __init__ method of the Hangman class according to the docstring already provided in the template. See the docstring for an explanation of the attributes.
